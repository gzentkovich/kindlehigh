# Starting Strength
## by Mark Rippetoe
- Exercise and training are two different things.
- Exercise is physical activity for its own sake, a workout done for the effect it produces today, during the workout or right after you’re through.
- Training is physical activity done with a longer-term goal in mind, the constituent workouts of which are specifically designed to achieve that goal.
- Simply described, this is what happens when a previously untrained person begins to lift weights – he gets stronger very quickly at first, and then improves less and less rapidly as he gets stronger and stronger.
- organisms adapt to their environment if the stress causes an adaptation and if the stress is not overwhelming in its magnitude.
- Weak people can obviously get stronger faster than strong people can. But that changes rapidly, and as you progress through your training career, your program should get more and more complicated as a result of the changing nature of your adaptive response.
- So, as a general rule, you need to try to add weight to the work sets of the exercise every time you train, until you can’t do this anymore.


# Attention! This Book Will Make You Money: How to Use Attention-Getting Online Marketing to Increase Your Revenue
## by Jim F. Kukral
- The one thing that those people have in common that you need to have is that they are the best at what they do, yes, but then they go out and consistently do it repeatedly in a unique way that gets the rest of us to pay attention.
- If there is one thing people who get noticed have in common, it’s that they all know how to produce tons of great content. There’s simply no way around the fact that the Web is dominated by businesses and individuals who have something powerful to say and then find as many ways as possible to say it. Delivering the message is sometimes more important than the message itself.
- How are you currently delivering your message to your audience? Is it through your blog? Great, but how about adding Web videos to that? Make your videos and upload them to YouTube, then post them on your blog. Now you’ve got your message delivered in two different places, all for the price of one. If you speak at events, are you recording the audio of your talk and then blogging about it later, or using it to give away as a bonus to your member program?
- Don’t send a letter, make a video.
- Perhaps the first step in figuring out how to think outrageously is first to understand that you’re not selling what you think you’re selling.
- “What’s it going to take to get every season ticket holder to renew this year?”
- As Spoelstra explains, the FedEx box was the headline and the rubber chicken was the subheadline. The only purpose of the headline is to get the prospect to read the subheadline. The purpose of the subheadline is to get the prospect to read the letter.
- One of the most important aspects of getting attention for your business is creating a memorable brand.
- You’ll also discover that there’s a secret weapon Carter uses to leverage his brand. He tells stories and people love stories. Stories captivate the reader and allow the reader to place their situation in the story. Carter tries to tell a story in each of his columns. Don’t ever underestimate the power of storytelling.
- people come to the Internet for two reasons and two reasons only: 1. To have a problem solved. 2. To be entertained.
- Customers buy from you because of what you can do for them to help them, not because of your logo or web site copy.
- The key to keeping customers in your sales funnel and getting them all the way through to an action is to make sure that you are offering them a path to follow.
- easy will always win.
- Choices are great on a menu, but too many choices on your web site or landing page or even with your products can cause indecision because of confusion, and when you’re in the business of trying to make a sale, confusion is the enemy.
- Examples of making it too hard are: • Poor navigation so your customer has to figure out where to go. • A poor unique value proposition (UVP). • Too many choices of products and services and not being clear about which one is the right choice for the customer. • Tons of drawn out copy that nobody wants to read. • Requiring a customer to register before they can buy from you.
- Are you a consultant? Maybe you can offer a free hour of your time to a customer who just needs some questions answered. You do realize that if you can get a potential customer on the phone or in person you have a much greater chance of closing

- underestimated. The people who established the business were outsiders, anxious to be regarded as Americans, as well as people who had suffered every kind of ethnic prejudice from disdain to pogrom.
- There’s a great deal of optimism in that shift—and a terrible price to pay when Americans tired of looking and realized the other hard work that needed to be done.
- Chaplin was a social climber.
- Chaplin was desperate to move us, while Keaton understood something about cinema that was ahead of his time: that the emotional connection being advertised was indirect and a mirage. The watching is rooted in detachment.

- For example, you tend to look for information that confirms your beliefs and ignore information that challenges them. This is called confirmation bias. The contents of your bookshelf and the bookmarks in your Web browser are a direct result of it.
- When a stimulus in the past affects the way you behave and think or the way you perceive another stimulus later on, it is called priming.
- adaptive unconscious—a
- You can prime potential employers with what you wear to a job interview.
- You can prime the emotions of your guests with how you set the mood when hosting a party.
- split-brain confabulation, but you don’t have to have a split brain to confabulate.
- If you are having a baby, you start to see babies everywhere.

- Believing you understand your motivations and desires, your likes and dislikes, is called the introspection illusion.
- Everyone is influencing every other person’s perception of reality thanks to another behavior called the illusion of transparency.
- This is the Dunning-Kruger effect, and it’s a basic element of human nature.
- cognitive biases
- The endowment effect pops up when you feel like the things you own are superior to the things you do not.
- The Forer effect is part of a larger phenomenon psychologists refer to as subjective validation, which is a fancy way of saying you are far
- more vulnerable to suggestion when the subject of the conversation is you.
- The psychologist Ray Hyman has spent most of his life studying the art of deception.
- When a group of people come together to make a decision, every demon in the psychological bestiary will be summoned.
- The stubbies are what evolutionary psychologists call supernormal releasers.
- In many studies around the world, no matter what cultural significance is placed on body type, a ratio in which the waist is about 70 percent the width of the hips is always preferred. According to Buss, a hip-to-waist ratio of .67 to .80 correlates to health, reproductive and otherwise. Women with this ratio truly are healthier, and this is something men know unconsciously. Psychologist Devendra Singh’s 1993 study of Playboy centerfolds showed although the women in the magazine had become thinner over the years, their average hip-to-waist ratio remained a constant .70.
- tendency to make poor decisions and ignore odds in favor of your gut feelings is called the affect heuristic.
- by the way the person smells,
- affect heuristic is the Holy Grail of cognitive biases in advertising and politics.
- tissues become Kleenex. Pain medicine becomes Aspirin. Bandages become Band-Aids.
- The oldest parts lie mostly in the hind-brain. These structures, among others, are concerned with your survival and help regulate all those things you don’t have to think about, like breathing and balancing on one foot. The mid-brain structures were shaped by your primate ancestors and grant you emotions and social awareness. The top layer, the most recently evolved, reasons and calculates. The frontal lobes and neocortex act as executive offices of the mind, taking suggestions from all other structures and formulating plans of action.
- reasoning “is preceded by a nonconscious biasing step that uses neural systems other than those that support declarative knowledge.” In other words, you are problem-solving before you are aware of it.
- He eventually divorced, lost his job, money, house, and everything else from his former life except the love of his parents, who took him in.
- The more something seems to benefit you, the less risky it seems overall.
- Sometimes, when the fear of failure is strong, you use a technique psychologists call self-handicapping to change the course of your future emotional state. Self-handicapping is a reality negotiation, an unconscious manipulation, of both your perceptions and those of others, that you use to protect your ego.
- Alter and Forgas concluded the happier you are, the more likely you will be to seek out ways to delude yourself into maintaining your rosy outlook on life and your own abilities. Sad people, it seems, are more honest with themselves.
- When you fear you will confirm a negative stereotype, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy not because the stereotype is true, but because you can’t stop worrying that you could become an example proving it.
- labeling theory
- The current self is happy when experiencing nice things. The remembering self is happy when you look back on your life and pull up plenty of positive memories.

# The Charisma Myth: How Anyone Can Master the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism
## by Olivia Fox Cabane
- When you meet a charismatic person, you get the impression that they have a lot of power and they like you a lot.
- Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences. Reduce how quickly and how often you nod. Pause for two full seconds before you speak.
- CHARISMATIC BEHAVIOR CAN be broken down into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth.
- We’re always partially distracted.
- The very next time you’re in a conversation, try to regularly check whether your mind is fully engaged or whether it is wandering elsewhere (including preparing your next sentence).


# The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses
## by Eric Ries
- The two most important assumptions entrepreneurs make are what I call the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis. The value hypothesis tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it.
- The point is not to find the average customer but to find early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.


# Steve Jobs
## by Walter Isaacson
- “Well, Steve, I think there’s more than one way of looking at it. I think it’s more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.”
- When Jobs arrived at the rock star’s townhouse, Jagger seemed baffled. He didn’t quite know who Jobs was. Later Jobs told his team, “I think he was on drugs. Either that or he’s brain-damaged.”
- Then he began to cry.
- Wes Smith of the Chicago Tribune said the launch was “to product demonstrations what Vatican II was to church meetings.”
- “I have many faults, but one of them is not ingratitude,” he responded. “Therefore, I have changed my position 180 degrees—we will freely help. Thanks for the clearer perspective.”
- “Gates went into a zone that recalls those science fiction films where a space alien, confronted with a novel object, creates some sort of force tunnel between him and the object, allowing him to suck directly into his brain all possible information about it.”
- “There’s a temptation in our networked age to think that ideas can be developed by email and iChat,”
- “That’s crazy. Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they’re doing, you say ‘Wow,’ and soon you’re cooking up all sorts of ideas.”
- if you’re not busy being born, you’re busy dying.
- He fell silent for a very long time. “But on the other hand, perhaps it’s like an on-off switch,” he said. “Click! And you’re gone.” Then he paused again and smiled slightly. “Maybe that’s why I never liked to put on-off switches on Apple devices.”


# Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science
